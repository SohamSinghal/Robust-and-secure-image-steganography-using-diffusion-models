# Robust-and-secure-image-steganography-using-diffusion-models
## Abstract
In our increasingly digital world, the demand for secure and discreet
communication methods has never been greater. This project presents an
innovative solution for secure message transmission by harnessing the power
of image steganography along with generative adversarial networks and diffusion models. Our approach involves the forward diffusion of a concealed
image into a cover image, allowing for the covert transmission of sensitive information between devices. When the concealed image is retrieved,
it can be seamlessly reverse-diffused to reveal the hidden message. This
method not only guarantees the confidentiality of the transmitted data but
also preserves the visual integrity of the cover image, making it an effective and imperceptible means of secure communication in an era marked by
heightened digital security concerns.
